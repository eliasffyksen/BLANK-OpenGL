# BLANK-OpenGL
BLANK-OpenGL is a blank c++ CMake project which includes OpenGL, GLFW, GLEW and GLM. This was made because it can be a strugle to set this up manually. Our goal is to make it platform independant, at least for win64, win32, MacOS and linux, however it does only work for win64 at the moment.

PS: On windows it must be compiled with mingw64, we are working on wingw32 so that one can compile for 32 bit windows as well.
